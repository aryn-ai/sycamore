# To start, run:
# % docker compose up
#
# What you should see:
#   1. wait while containers are downloaded (speed depends on your network), or nothing once cached
#   2a. crawler should run and download 1 sample pdf
#   2b. demo ui starting (in parallel with 2a)
#   3. lots of logging as opensearch starts. Eventually 'Waiting for opensearch to exit.'
#   4. sycamore container downloading pytorch files then running ray to import
#   5. UI ready to go on port localhost:3000 (it's accessible before this but won't work)
#
# Troubleshooting/Extensions:
#   1. Something is messed up, I just want to reset:
#      Follow the instructions in reset.yaml
#   2. I want more sort benchmark files:
#      Follow the instructions in sort-all.yaml
