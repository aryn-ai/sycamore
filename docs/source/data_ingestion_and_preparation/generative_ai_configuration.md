# Generative AI configuration for data preparation

Sycamore brings generative AI to a variety of stages in data preparation for search. You can choose different LLMs for entity extraction, schema extraction, vector embedding, and more. Currently, Sycamore supports OpenAI and Amazon Bedrock for vector embedding.

Information on supported generative AI models for each operation are in the specific documentation for it:

* [Embeddings](/transforms/embed.md)
* [Entity extraction](/transforms/extract_entity.md)
* [Schema extraction](/transforms/extract_schema.md)
* [Summarize](/transforms/summarize.md)
