# Installing Sycamore libraries locally

You can install and use the Sycamore data preparation libraries locally to write and iterate on custom code. 

## Installation 

Sycamore currently runs on for Linux and Mac OS, and please see the top of the README for Python version compatibility. To install, run 

`pip install sycamore-ai`

For certain PDF processing operations, you also need to installâ€¯poppler, which you can do with the OS-native package manager of your choice. For example, the command for Homebrew on Mac OS is: 

`brew install poppler`
