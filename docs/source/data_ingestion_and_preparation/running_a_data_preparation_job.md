# Running Custom Data Preparation Code 

Once you have written your data preparation code, you can now use it to process data when loading it into Sycamore.  

## Using Jupyter container 

The easiest way to use your data processing code is to use the Jupyter notebook shell in the Sycamore-Jupyter container. You enable this container when deploying Sycamore. [LINK] 

Add your code to the bind-dir XXX NEED THIS INFO! 

Go to your Jupyter notebook server and go to Jupyter shell 

Run this command: 

XXXXXXXXXXXXX 

You can also choose to run your data processing code from the Docker terminal by: 
 

XXXXXXXXX 


## Using Sycamore-Importer container 

If you do not choose to run the Jupyter container, you can copy your code to the Sycamore-Importer container and run it there. However, we don’t recommend this, as there is no bind-dir configured for this container. 

To run your code: 

 
Copy your code to the Sycamore-Importer container: 

 

XXXXXX 

 

Run the code using this command: 


## Running Sycamore locally 

You can run Sycamore’s data processing library locally and load the output into your Sycamore stack. To do this, run: 

 

XXXXXXXXXXX 

 

Note: Make sure your code has the proper configuration for your Sycamore stack’s endpoint. 

 

You can also use Jupyter locally for this, and an example is here. [NEED LINK]
