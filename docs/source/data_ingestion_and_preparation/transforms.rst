Transforms
============

In Sycamore, a transform is a method that operates on a ``DocSet`` and returns a new ``DocSet``. Sycamore provides a number of these transforms directly in the ``DocSet`` class to prepare and enhance your unstructured data. In order to support a variety of data types and machine learning models, many of these transforms are customizable with different implementations.
