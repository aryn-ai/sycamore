## Using the Demo Query UI

Sycamore includes a simple UI to submit queries and display retreival-augmented generation (RAG) answers and hybrid search results. The UI is deployed in the conatiner `sycamore-demo-ui` and is accessed at `localhost:3000`. It is an easy way to test the answer quality from your Sycamore stack, and how iterating with your data preparation and enrichment affects the overal quality.

You can create a new conversation by entering the name in the text box in the "Conversations" panel and hit enter. Then, you can submit questions in the middle panel.
