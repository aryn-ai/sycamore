# Remote Search Processors

> ðŸ‘‰ For information on OpenSearch search processors, visit the [opensearch documentation](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/search-plugins/search-pipelines/index/)

Sycamore exposes a number of search processors in addition to the ones built in to OpenSearch.
We accomplish this with a search processor in OpenSearch called â€˜remote-processorâ€™.
This processor makes a network call to the Sycamore service hosting the search processors.


These search processors include:

- `dedup`: de-duplicates search results.  See [here](dedup.md).
- `debug`: prints the search response to stdout. Useful for debugging.

The processors running by default are specified in a config file: [remote-processor-service/config/pipelines.yml](https://github.com/aryn-ai/sycamore/blob/main/apps/remote-processor-service/config/pipelines.yml).
The default Sycamore search pipelines use the `dedup02` remote search processor, which applies a "medium-light" amount of near-duplicate removal to search responses.

```yaml
- debug:
    processors:
      - debug-response:
- dedup02:
    processors:
      - dedup-response:
          threshold: 0.15
```

You can add a hosted remote processor to a search pipeline using standard OpenSearch search pipeline creation syntax:

```lang-http
PUT /_search/pipeline/pipeline-with-remote-dedup
{
  "response_processors": [
    {
      "remote_processor": {
        "endpoint": "https://rps:2796/RemoteProcessorService/ProcessResponse"
        "processor_name": "dedup"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

The `processor_name` should point to the top-level name of the processor you want to call.
