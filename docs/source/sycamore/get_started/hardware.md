# Recommended resources to run Sycamore

We recommend at least 4GB of RAM to run Sycamore.

We recommend using the Aryn Partitioner for the highest quality PDF processing. By default, the Aryn Partitioner is configured to use the Aryn Partitioning Service, a GPU-backed serverless endpoint. You can sign up for free [here](https://www.aryn.ai/get-started), and use it with your Sycamore job.

If you choose to configure your Aryn Partitioner to run locally, your performance will vary without using an NVIDIA GPU.
