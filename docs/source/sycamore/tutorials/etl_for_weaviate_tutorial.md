# Loading Weaviate with Sycamore

[This tutorial](https://github.com/aryn-ai/sycamore/blob/main/notebooks/weaviate-writer.ipynb) shows how to create an ETL pipeline with Sycamore to load a Weaviate vector database. It walks through how to use Sycamore to partition, extract, clean, chunk, embed, and load your data. You will need an [Aryn Partitioning Service API key](https://www.aryn.ai/get-started) and an [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/signup) (for LLM-powered data enrichment and creating vector embeddings). At the time of writing, there are free trial or free tier options for all of these services.

Run this tutorial [locally with Jupyter](https://github.com/aryn-ai/sycamore/blob/main/notebooks/weaviate-writer.ipynb).
