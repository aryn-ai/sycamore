# Using Sycamore's data prep libraries locally

This tutorial provides a walkthrough of how to use Sycamore's data preparation libraries locally to prepare, enhance, and embed a PDF dataset from S3 and load it into a local Sycamore stack. We encourage to go over [Sycamore's architecture](../welcome_to_sycamore/architecture.md) before you work through this tutorial. We will be using unstructured PDFs from the [Sort Benchmark](http://sortbenchmark.org/) website. This data is publicly available in S3 here, so you do not need AWS credentials to access it: s3://aryn-public/sort-benchmark/pdf/

## Steps

1. Install Sycamore using pip using [these instructions](../data_ingestion_and_preparation/installing_sycamore_libraries_locally.md)

2. Create a Python script and import Sycamore. In the following code snippet, we are initializing Sycamore and creating a DocSet by reading all the files from a local path.

```python
import sycamore

# local file path to the SortBenchmark dataset
paths = "s3://aryn-public/sort-benchmark/pdf/"

# Initializng sycamore which also initializes Ray underneath
context = sycamore.init()

# Creating a DocSet
docset = context.read.binary(paths, parallelism=1, binary_format="pdf")
```

```{note}
At any point if you want to inspect the docset, you can use docset.show() method
```

3. Next, we want to partition all the PDFs and generate elements so that we can extract relevant entities later on. We will use the partition transform to achieve this.

```python
from sycamore.transforms.partition import UnstructuredPdfPartitioner

# We are using UnstructuredPdfPartitioner to partion the documents.
# Sycamore supports pluggable partitioners for different formats.
docset = docset.partition(partitioner=UnstructuredPdfPartitioner())
```

4. Now, since we know that titles and authors are important entities in our dataset, let's extract them using OpenAI with the `extract_entity` transform. In this case, we are going to use few shot entity extraction, where we provide some examples to the model of what to extract:

```python
from sycamore.transforms.extract_entity import OpenAIEntityExtractor
from sycamore.llms import OpenAIModels, OpenAI
import os

# The following prompt templates will be used to extract the relevant entities
title_prompt_template = """

    ELEMENT 5: Ganymede, or Jupiter III, is the largest and most massive natural satellite of Jupiter as well as in the Solar System, being a planetary-mass moon. It is the largest Solar System object without an atmosphere, despite being the only moon of the Solar System with a magnetic field. Like Titan, it is larger than the planet Mercury, but has somewhat less surface gravity than Mercury, Io or the Moon.

# We are using OpenAIEntityExtractor which utilizes OpenAI and gpt-3.5-turbo model.
# You can write your own EntityExtractor as well.

# Replace the "api_key" with your API Key.
openai_llm = OpenAI(OpenAIModels.GPT_3_5_TURBO.value, api_key=os.environ.get("OPENAI_API_KEY"))

docset = docset.extract_entity(

)
.extract_entity(
    entity_extractor=OpenAIEntityExtractor("authors", llm=openai_llm, prompt_template=author_prompt_template)
)
```

5. Next, we want to convert each element of a document into a top/parent level document. Additionally, we also want to generate embeddings for these documents. We will use the explode and embed transform respectively to achieve this.

```python
from sycamore.transforms.embed import SentenceTransformerEmbedder

# We are using SentenceTransformerEmbedder to embed the content of each document; which
# uses the SentenceTransformer model. You can write your own Embedder as well.
docset = docset.explode()
.embed(embedder=SentenceTransformerEmbedder(batch_size=100, model_name="sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2")
```

6. Lastly, we want to write these documents into the local Sycamore stack. Make sure that you have it [running locally](../welcome_to_sycamore/get_started.md).

```python
openSearch_client_args = {
        "hosts": [{"host": "localhost", "port": 9200}],
        "http_compress": True,
        "http_auth": ("admin", "admin"),
        "use_ssl": True,
        "verify_certs": False,
        "ssl_assert_hostname": False,
        "ssl_show_warn": False,
        "timeout": 120,
    }

    index_settings = {
        "body": {
            "settings": {
                "index.knn": True,
                "number_of_shards": 5,
                "number_of_replicas": 1,
            },
            "mappings": {
                "properties": {
                    "embeddings": {
                        "type": "knn_vector",

                }
            },
        }
    }

docset.write.opensearch(
        os_client_args=openSearch_client_args,
        index_name="sort-benchmark",
        index_settings=index_settings,
    )
```

Congrats - you have now processed and loaded your dataset from S3 into your Sycamore stack!
