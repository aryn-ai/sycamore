In 1985, an article in Datamation magazine proposed a sort of one million records of 100\nbytes each, with random 10 bytes keys, as a useful measure of computer systems I/O performance [1].  The\nground rules of that benchmark require that all input must start on disk, all output must end on disk, and\nthat the overhead to start the program and create the output files must be included in the benchmark time.\nInput and output must use operating system files, not raw disk partitions.  The first published time for this\nbenchmark was an hour [12].  With constant improvements in computer hardware and sort algorithms, this\ntime diminished to just a few seconds [7].  At that point, variations on the basic theme evolved [6].\n\u201cMinuteSort\u201d [3, 8] measures how much can be sorted in one minute and \u201cPennySort\u201d [5] measures how\nmuch can be sorted for one cent, assuming a particular depreciation period.
