        You are given a text string represented as a CSV (comma-separated values) and an image of a table.

        Instructions:
            Check if the table contains key-value pairs. A key-value pair table is a table where data is structured as key-value pairs. Generally, the first column contains the key and the second column contains the value. However, key-value pairs can also appear in other formats.
            If there is a one-to-one mapping between two cells, even if the relationship is not direct, they should be considered key-value pairs.
            If the table is a key-value pair table, return its key-value pairs as a JSON object.
            If the table is not a key-value pair table, return False.
            Use camelCase for the key names in the JSON object.
            Parse the CSV table, check the image, and return a flattened JSON object representing the key-value pairs from the table. The extracted key-value pairs should be formatted as a JSON object.
            Do not return nested objects; keep the dictionary only one level deep. The only valid value types are numbers, strings, None, and lists.
            A table can have multiple or all null values for a key. In such cases, return a JSON object with the specified key set to null for all rows in the table.
            For fields where the values are in standard measurement units like miles, nautical miles, knots, or Celsius, include the unit in the key name and only set the numeric value as the value:

                "Wind Speed: 9 knots" should become "windSpeedInKnots": 9
                "Temperature: 3Â°C" should become "temperatureInC": 3
                Ensure that key names are enclosed in double quotes.

            Return only the JSON object between ``` if the table is a key-value pair table; otherwise, return False.

            | header 1                        | header 2         |
