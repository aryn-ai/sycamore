            3. If you find multiple fields defined in a row, feel free to split them into separate properties.
            4. Use camelCase for the key names.
            5. For fields where the values are in standard measurement units like miles, 
            nautical miles, knots, or celsius, include the unit in the key name and only set the
            numeric value as the value.
              - "Wind Speed: 9 knots" should become "windSpeedInKnots": 9
