    "Georgia" and an isoDateTime field between July 1, 2023, and September 30, 2024:

        }
    }

    The full range of OpenSearch Query DSL parameters are supported.
    Whenever possible, use the query parameter to filter data at the source, as this is more
    efficient than filtering data in subsequent data filtering operators.
