These complaints, brought by a number of different types of plaintiffs under a variety of legal\ntheories, generally allege that rebate agreements between the drug manufacturers and PBMs caused inflated prices for certain drug products.___FINANCEBENCH_DELIMITER___In December 2022, the Company agreed to a formal settlement agreement, the financial amounts of which were agreed to in principle in October 2022, with a\nleadership group of a number of state Attorneys General and the Plaintiffs’ Executive Committee (“PEC”). The agreement would resolve substantially all\nopioid claims against Company entities by states and political subdivisions, but not private plaintiffs.
