The documents come from [data.gov](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/college-credit-card-marketing-agreements-data), but we have made them accessible via S3.  There are two ingestion commands to choose from, depending on how realistic or quick the demo should be:\n",

    "For the full dataset, it's OK to proceed once the importer queue shrinks to ~100 documents.  It's not necessary for 100% of the documents to be ingested in order to run this example.  Due to variations in ingestion, results may not exactly match what's described here.  Note that for the full dataset, ~17 documents will fail to ingest for various reasons.  The Sycamore importer will keep retrying them, but the problems will persist.\n",
