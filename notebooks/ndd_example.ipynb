    "To use this notebook:\n",
    "1. Follow [these instructions](https://sycamore.readthedocs.io/en/stable/welcome_to_sycamore/get_started.html) and start the Sycamore containers using `docker compose up`.\n",

The documents come from [data.gov](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/college-credit-card-marketing-agreements-data), but we have made them accessible via S3.  There are two ingestion commands to choose from, depending on how much time is available:\n",

    "    - All ~2000 PDFs (4+ hours): `docker compose run sycamore_crawler_s3 aryn-public cccmad`\n",
    "\n",
    "The results below are from the 35-document dataset, which we think most users will choose.  The full dataset will provide different results.  There may be variations even in the small dataset due to platform differences and OpenAI variation.  This is real-world data and there may be problems ingesting certain documents.  It's not necessary for 100% of the documents to be ingested in order to run this example.  Once the lion's share completes, it's OK to proceed.\n",

This enables NDD processing; without `shingles` it can't detect near-duplicates.  Now, when we run the query there is much more diversity in the retrieved chunks.  When run on the small dataset, there appears to be just one duplicate that gets past NDD and it appears to be some sort of revision.  Looking at the generated answer, there are more cited sources and the explanation is richer.  It covers topics like modifying obligations and prior obligations, not included above.
