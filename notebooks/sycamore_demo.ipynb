The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring signiﬁcantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English- to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.0 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature.\n",

    "    ELEMENT 5: and their use in prediction. These frameworks often lever- age specialized hardware (e.g., GPUs and TPUs), with the goal of reducing training time in a batch setting. Examples include TensorFlow [7], MXNet [18], and PyTorch [46]. The promise of AI is, however, far broader than classi- cal supervised learning. Emerging AI applications must increasingly operate in dynamic environments, react to changes in the environment, and take sequences of ac- tions to accomplish long-term goals [8, 43]. They must aim not only to exploit the data gathered, but also to ex- plore the space of possible actions. These broader require- ments are naturally framed within the paradigm of rein- forcement learning (RL). RL deals with learning to oper- ate continuously within an uncertain environment based on delayed and limited feedback [56]. RL-based systems have already yielded remarkable results, such as Google's AlphaGo beating a human world champion [54], and are beginning to ﬁnd their way into dialogue systems, UAVs [42], and robotic manipulation [25, 60].\n",

Ray implements a uniﬁed interface that can express both task-parallel and actor-based computations, supported by a single dynamic execution engine. To meet the perfor- mance requirements, Ray employs a distributed scheduler and a distributed and fault-tolerant store to manage the system's control state.
